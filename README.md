# NeuralPotentials

This repository contains the work I did on the topic on neural potentials. It contains a Jupyter notebook with an introduction on neural potentials using harmonic oscillators as well as all the code that was used to analyze various astrophysical and cosmological problems. The repository also contains the Master's thesis on which the project is based. THe thesis serves as a reference and handbook for the project.

## Setup of the Project

ALL the code is written in Julia, therefore it is imperative to install it on your machine. Follow the instructions under ... to install the latest version on Windows/Linux/Mac.
The relevant Julia packages are:
* DifferentialEquations
* CSV
* Plots
* LateXStrings

## Harmonic Oscillator

## Sagittrius A*

## Redshift-Luminosity Data of Supernovae Ia
